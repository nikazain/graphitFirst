Challenges included integrating LLMs with broad client’s database, requiring extensive data preprocessing and mapping, using OpenAI and Llama for effective integration. A significant achievement was the development of an interviewer system, leveraging the database to recommend candidates based on their .pdf CVs ranked across multiple parameters. Additionally, an 'inner assistant' was created to facilitate query responses and content generation for an e-learning platform, with technologies such as Langchain enhancing accessibility.

To work with documents we will use Langchain/RAG for model to directly access and analyse documents required. Also we will be able to generate illustrations in pretty much the same style, however it might take some time to deduct style of liking. However, for PoC without delving too much into exact details of style we would be able to generate sketches which will look like pencil drawn e.g. I added one i generated within few prompts in Dalle, that's the generator which would be easiest to use for PoC since it operates through API, therefore we don't need to train nor host the model saving significant time and money.

      "Akash Singh: Did you develop any LLM model from scratch , or can you develop ?",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Hey, Yes, I have worked with transformers and with implementing and further tuning various models including llamas, Gpt models and other. Also, developing complex features and training processes for them. This development process is called fine-tunning, where you take existing models and train them to serve your purpose, that's what companies implementing LLMs in their operations do, like retail stores, real estates, lawyers, etc. As for developing whole foundational part of model from scratch, that's what OpenAI, Facebook do, as it requires millions in computer power and human expenses AS",
      "Akash Singh: so which area is your expertise",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Basically, I can build pretty much model of any complexity, if we are talking for business application. I was fortunate to get leading positions at projects and very advanced responsibilities when LLM boom started Only part of the field I don't have experience with is the most advanced scientific development which is applied to improve large applications and foundational models themselves e.g. developing ChatGPT itself and not application based on it But i have experience developing different kinds of assistants and applications with different requireemnts e.g. hosted locally, working with multiple languages, answers technical questions e.g. what part of law this is connected too, talks in different tone e.g. model talks like psychologist with empathy and not like regular chatgpt, asking customers for more info and processing their information to streamline it for customer support I assume you need an assistant for customers of e-commerce platform? I can do that and we can arrange a call to discuss details. Recently, I had a call regarding an assistant for a retail chain of petshops, who are considering building an assistant to recommend products based on specific needs of different pets and characteristics of the products AS",

We did a research and speaking honestly to you are unsure if we have enough people of this level of expertise to deliver you high value you desire.

      "Patrick Gerard: Hi, how would you tackle our problem in a technical way?",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: It's quite challenging problem, I see multiple steps needed to do it effectively. The core part would be fine-tuning for model to mimic human style of writing. There are plenty of datasets available for this purpose. However, important part here would be to prescreen datasets, to not waste resources on training of lower quality datasets. It could be done by using separate model to evaluate datasets using brief sample from dataset and checking how it operates if \"trained\" on those. This approach was efficient on my other project, which required extensive fine-tuning. Secondly, we will play around with various models, if there is no strict model requirement. I suspect that certain models, probably more niche ones, are less prone to detection by mainstream detectors. Again this part depends on exact task. Further, we would need to research in details how detectors work and additional instructions for model e.g. detectors are flagging repetition of same words so we instruct model to not use the same word more than twice per page. Lastly, we would need to establish comprehensive evaluation, probably using APIs from mutliple gpt detectors or just manually, depending on the quality of our model and accuracy requirements.

      "Patrick Gerard: Can you tell me why? Friday, Mar 22, 2024",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: NLP is very narrow, like using it you can hard-code some parts e.g. to change certain words into something else but overall LLM does it. For instance, you would tell LLM to not repeat words which detectors usually flag and instead to use synonyms. Overall, there is no point in using NLP since it's very limited in what in can do in LLM setting, these days it is usually more applied in standardised settings, everywhere else LLM is usually a lot better Saturday, Mar 23, 2024",

Secondly, if you have any particular detectors you need to go around or other certain requirements.

I would love to discuss more, and might have had a project utilizing some similar approaches recently (Jira with LLM incorporation). Specifically, I wonder what do you see as the key functionality of the platform and its key advantage -Do you know already what data you want to use and how? Or would we need to identify all of the data sources and the ways to collect the data -Are there any specific milestones you want to achieve before your vacation and before the final deadline of July 5? What i would suggest to do next is to schedule a call and discuss in more details. I see this kind of a task as heavily reliant on communication and it's hard to tell much now. Also, regardless of your decision, wish you all the best luck with the project! It is exciting times now to explore new technologies 🙂 Wednesday, Jun 12, 2024",

      "Chiara Lefrancois: Dear Mykola, Your profile seems to align perfectly with the requirements of our current project and we are eager to learn more about your approach. The main objective of our project is to extract data from a chosen public website and use it to train a LLM. We would like to interact with the LLM and generate accurate responses based on the extracted data. A specificity of this project is our wish to develop a low-code solution. Before scheduling a meeting, we would appreciate it if you could briefly express your thoughts on this project and your proposed approach. We look forward to hearing from you soon. Best, Chiara Lefrançois",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Hey Chiara, Glad it aligns:) Yes, sure, here is quick break down based on what I understand currently about your project: Here are the two potential approaches I see so far and what we go with depends more on the task itself. Option 1: We go with multi agent approach (new stream in LLMs) that communicate between each other to best solve your task e.g. one agents scraps data and the other evaluates if it sufficient or the first agent needs to do more work. We can use agents to either build the dataset and add a separate model to them or to make them do complete task. Multiagent frameworks like Langraph and CrewAi have ready data extraction tools so it should serve well our purpose. In one notable project, I led the creation of an agent-based workflow. This system enabled agents to autonomously extract data from public websites, verify its accuracy, and retrieve relevant information. These agents were designed to seamlessly integrate extracted data with existing records from internal SQL databases. Option 2: More standard industry approach currently used is with RAG. We extract data, build a Vector database and run RAG on it to perform the search. I built a RAG tailored to a specialized knowledge base. This integration allowed the agents to efficiently gather information from diverse sources and conduct in-depth research. The goal was to ascertain the relevance of the data to specific user scenarios, ensuring the delivery of accurate and applicable information. Additionally, I have extensive fine-tuning experience, in case if we would need it at any of the stages to increase output accuracy. The final solution could be built using either option or could be a combination of both, depending on how you want to manipulate data, is it static or dynamic and what exact final outcome you are aiming to achieve. Also, If you would clarify what you mean by low-code solution, is it utilizing little coding ourselves for execution or developing a low-code platform that utilizes the extracted data? I would behappy to discuss it further Monday, Jun 17, 2024 CL",
      "Chiara Lefrancois: Dear Mykola, Thank you for your reply. We appreciate the level of detail! However, I regret to inform you that we have decided to move forward with a different team structure for this project. We keep your contact information on file and will reach out if we have any future project that may be better fit. In the meantime, we wish you very much success. Best, Chiara Lefrançois",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Hey Chiara I'm very sorry to hear that. Could you please tell me the reason why you didn't continue the development with me? I'm sure your feedback will help me in the future. And of course, GL with the project!"

      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Hi Thomas, I prefer Azure but if needed i can figure out vertex, I worked with Amazon too and the core of platforms is usually quite similar. It is not public, we pretty much finished AI part and they will be building the rest of platform now, I am attaching example of question and output it gives. I know LexisNexis AI, there is not much info available about it, LexisNexis platform is large but genuinely speaking, comparing our outputs to the outputs they have in the video on the website, i think our outputs are even better than their at this point. I won't be able to extend the solution to your case, but I would be able to use experience from there and possibly some small parts of code. The IP of the solution belongs to the client so i can't freely copy it and we would still need to set up environments for you, there is no really point in it even. Especially for PoC. I did multiple projects with RAG and employed quite advanced techniques with it. RAG quality depends quite a bit on the way you structure data and the type of search you use, and it becomes more important the more data you have to search from. For frontend, for PoC streamlit is really good, it allows fast deployment of front-end for AI applications. It is really convenient framework for AI apps PoCs. . I have some parts ready for the apps like your, for instance Pinecone RAG integration. The PoC you are looking for would be fast to build, however to tell you better timelines I would love to talk to you. The thing with RAG applications and PoC compared to production apps, is that RAG for PoC now would be easy to build but if you would be looking to ingest a lot of legal documents later on, you would need strong AI expertise on your side at that point. Let me know what times you are available and let's talk about it in more details."

I’ve got a solid background in building and optimizing large language models, especially with Mistral. Here’s a bit about what I’ve been up to: PEFT Implementation: • LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): Used LoRA to fine-tune Mistral/Llama models efficiently without heavy computational costs. • QLoRA with 4-bit Quantization: Implemented QLoRA during training to reduce memory requirements while maintaining performance. • Prompt Tuning with P-tuning v2: Applied this for task-specific adaptations to get the models to perform just right for specific tasks. Model Size Reduction Pipeline: • Pruning: • Employed structured pruning techniques targeting attention heads and MLP layers to streamline the model. • Used magnitude pruning to remove the least important weights and make the model leaner. • Quantization: • Applied post-training quantization using the bitsandbytes library. • Implemented INT8 and INT4 quantization for efficient inference. • Used dynamic quantization for attention layers while keeping critical layers in higher precision. • Integrated GPTQ quantization for even more efficient inference. • Knowledge Distillation: • Set up a teacher-student architecture where a larger Mistral model taught smaller versions. • Implemented intermediate layer distillation with custom loss functions to retain performance. Infrastructure & Scaling: • Kubernetes Setup: • Configured A100 GPU clusters using NVIDIA GPU Operator for powerful training capabilities. • Used Helm charts for easy deployment management. • Set up auto-scaling based on GPU utilization to optimize resources. I’m ready to hit the ground running and help build your custom LLM. I can start ASAP, and I estimate that developing, fine-tuning, and deploying the optimized model would take about 8-10 weeks. Just a couple of questions: • Can you share more about the specific use case or domain the LLM will focus on? • Are there any particular tools or platforms your team prefers? • What key performance indicators are you aiming to achieve with this model? Looking forward to potentially working together and bringing this project to life! Let me know if you need any more info."

On top of that, we would need to build something on top of that, on how to price second hand.Alternatively, we could try to fetch prices not from first hand retailers but from second hand retailers, although in that case my assumption is that catalog would be limited, limiting it to one-two product categories could be easiest at the start.

      "Abdul Rehman: Hi Mykola, Thank you for applying for the job. My name is Abdul Rehman, and I work with Sarab as a data analyst. I would like to learn more about your approach. Could you explain how you would integrate an Excel/Google Sheet containing several thousand rows and multiple columns into an LLM’s context to ensure it responds to quantitative queries with precise answers, using a chain of thought reasoning process? Could you detail what model, techniques, tools, and technologies you would utilize to achieve this? Looking forward to your response. Best Regards, Abdul Rehman Thursday, Jan 30",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Thanks for the question. I would approach this problem in the following way: Instead of feeding all the Excel/.csv data into the model (which at some point becomes impossible due to the context window limitation), I would use an LLM to generate a script (Python commands) that extracts only the necessary information based on the user's request. This approach is typically used in text-to-SQL problems, where we have a large amount of structured data in a database, but all that data cannot be stored within the LLM for a single inference run. In such cases, we fine-tune our LLM for the query generation task. In your case, the tabular data could be converted into a Pandas DataFrame format (if there's a large volume of data, we can use Spark), and those Pandas DataFrames could be \"queried\" by the LLM. In this approach, we format the data schema appropriately and feed it into the context window (which has more than enough space for the column descriptions and dtypes). Regarding reasoning, this is usually used in multi-agent systems. In your case, I would suggest having at least three AI agents: - One responsible for \"query script\" generation - A second one for query validation The agents can employ the ToT (Tree of Thoughts) approach, which facilitates the exploration of multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. At the end, the AI agents will provide a qualified and validated subset of rows, which will be used by a third agent responsible for generating chat responses. Each of these agents will be fine-tuned to solve its respective task. With this approach, we break down the complex logic and assign each part to a specific AI agent, trained to handle its respective task, ultimately enhancing overall system performance. I would suggest starting the development with vanilla pay-per-usage models like Claude or OpenAI. The latter can be fine-tuned. Based on the performance, I would then choose an open-source model such as Llama, Mistral, or even DeepSeek, which offer more flexibility for fine-tuning. Regarding tools, I would recommend using either LangChain / LangGraph (for multi-agent flow) because of their ecosystems, which simplify deployment during development and provide integration for tracing. As for cloud providers, I can develop using any of them (AWS, Azure, GCP) or even deploy everything on-premise. We can proceed with the environment you are already using. If you do not have any hosted infrastructure, I prefer moving forward with AWS. Friday, Jan 31 AR",

    "Project Description": " Voice Assistant App Development for Patient Engagement Mobile App Development Posted Jan 31, 2025 We are a medical office in the USA. Looking to save the providers time simply asking the long history many patients will add. We are seeking a skilled developer to create an innovative mobile or web application that utilizes voice assistance to engage patients and gather their medical history. I picture something like openai AI advanced voice assistant that has an icon that engages the patient and uses the LLM with an integrated file for knowledge we've given it to ask the right questions to get a full history. Ideally it is engaging, friendly, and can even make jokes if the patient is not speaking. The app should implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) to accurately engage patients and speech to text to then save transcripts of patient interactions. This project aims to enhance patient experience and streamline data collection for healthcare providers. It does NEED TO BE HIPAA compliant so a BAA will have to be signed. I currently have one with openai, google, and aws. If you have experience in app development, voice technology, current solution (happy to pay a consultant if you can help us implement) and NLP, we want to hear from you!",

Andrew Sunday, Feb 02",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: 1. Start with online cloud based solutions as it would be faster to roll-out, more convenient in terms of development, scalability and availability and still compliant. I would recommend going with OpenAI initially as it grants fast deployment and are state of the art, and depending on performance or additional requirements fine-tune open-source models (mainly llamas, deepseek wouldn't be compliant) for more specific outcomes. That's the approach i used in both building mental health assistant which is engaging and empathetic as well as very similar to your solution for homecare industry. 2. Web application first, it's easier to do it fast as a proof of value, so we can see where the technology is lacking and what needs to be improved in the data collection process, while starting to develop mobile in parallel. Basically, key idea is getting to feedback fast and improve iteratively from there. 3. 30k-60k usd depending on the complexity of the app, do you want AI analysis on top of information gathered, do you want to tune voice models 4.

We still will have agent constructing answers thougn 3) I would recommend, that's how i built it in legal project, to add review agent which will check if answer is factually right and is anwering the query, sending it back to AI to work on if it's bad and passing it to human if it's good, basically one more step in your flow Let's discuss it further on the call, i did something very similar and believe will be able to help you Thursday, Feb 20 ST",

      "Sindhu Nellibandla: Hi, Thank you for your proposal. We have shortlisted your submission and would like a more detailed version focusing on: AI-Powered Candidate Search: How will the system use AI and NLP to query the database and display relevant candidates for a job post based on different filters. Candidate Shortlisting: How will the system use AI/ML to automatically provide a shortlist of top candidates from the database for a posted job? Please include a fixed cost quote, project timeline, and milestones. Let me know your availability for a call this week between 9AM and 4PM CST. Best Regards, Sindhu Nellibandla Product Manager Thursday, Feb 13",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Hey Sindhu, Nice to hear from you! What about 9am CST tomorrow? I would approach this problem in the following way: Instead of feeding all the Excel/.csv data into the model (which at some point becomes impossible due to the context window limitation), I would use an LLM to generate a script (Python commands) that extracts only the necessary information based on the user's request. This approach is typically used in text-to-SQL problems, where we have a large amount of structured data in a database, but all that data cannot be stored within the LLM for a single inference run. In such cases, we fine-tune our LLM for the query generation task. In your case, the tabular data could be converted into a Pandas DataFrame format (if there's a large volume of data, we can use Spark), and those Pandas DataFrames could be \"queried\" by the LLM. In this approach, we format the data schema appropriately and feed it into the context window (which has more than enough space for the column descriptions and dtypes). Regarding reasoning, this is usually used in multi-agent systems. In your case, I would suggest having at least three AI agents: - One responsible for \"query script\" generation - A second one for query validation The agents can employ the ToT (Tree of Thoughts) approach, which facilitates the exploration of multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. At the end, the AI agents will provide a qualified and validated subset of rows, which will be used by a third agent responsible for generating chat responses. Each of these agents will be fine-tuned to solve its respective task. With this approach, we break down the complex logic and assign each part to a specific AI agent, trained to handle its respective task, ultimately enhancing overall system performance. I would suggest starting the development with vanilla pay-per-usage models like Claude or OpenAI. The latter can be fine-tuned. Based on the performance, I would then choose an open-source model such as Llama, Mistral, or even DeepSeek, which offer more flexibility for fine-tuning. Regarding tools, I would recommend using either LangChain / LangGraph (for multi-agent flow) because of their ecosystems, which simplify deployment during development and provide integration for tracing. As for cloud providers, I can develop using any of them (AWS, Azure, GCP) or even deploy everything on-premise. We can proceed with the environment you are already using. If you do not have any hosted infrastructure, I prefer moving forward with AWS. Regarding timeline and miletstones, it is hard to tell exactly now. I would expect that we would be able to build initial version in around a month time Tuesday, Feb 18 SN",

Extract Key Information Once the transcription is complete, the next step is to extract relevant information about the back-office process from the text Here we will use general purpose LLMs (e.g. gpt ) and if needed break down the process of constructing workflow into steps and make AI describe each of the steps 3. Generate the diagram This step is slightly more complex but not much, basically based on key information we would make AI generate a query with a description of a digram which would be connected through API to diagram drawing tool, sending automatic requests for diagram creation (e.g. DrawIO) 4.

    "Project Description": " AI Platform Enhancement: Implement Vector Similarity Search Generative AI Modeling Invite Only Posted Apr 4, 2025 We are looking for an experienced developer to enhance our AI platform by adding/integrating vector similarity search in order to greatly imporve results to users. Our Tech Stack & Structure: Framework: Next.js (Monorepo housing both frontend and backend) Backend: Node.js with TypeScript (Code located in local/APIs/) Frontend: React with TypeScript (Code located in components/) Search & Embeddings: Elasticsearch is used to store and search embedded document data. Embeddings are currently generated using Voyage AI models. Retrieval Pipeline: Current process involves BM25 retrieval followed by Voyage AI Reranker v2. Primary Database: PostgreSQL holds user data (questions, answers, files). Hosting: UI hosted on Vercel. Authentication: Clerk handles user authentication. Environment: Single GitHub repository for the entire application. Please note that we also use Langchain. THE PLAN Implement Vector Search: Configure Elasticsearch to perform vector similarity searches using your existing Voyage-3 embeddings. You'll need to embed the user's query using the same Voyage-3 model. Perform Hybrid Retrieval: For each user query, perform both: BM25 Search: Retrieve the top K documents based on keyword relevance. Vector Search: Retrieve the top M documents based on semantic relevance using the embedded query and the indexed vectors. (Choosing K and M often requires experimentation, but starting with values like K=50, M=50 is common). Combine and Deduplicate: Merge the results from both BM25 (K documents) and Vector Search (M documents) into a single candidate list. Remove any duplicate documents that were retrieved by both methods. You will now have a list of up to K+M unique documents. Rerank: Pass this combined list of candidate documents (along with the original query) to your Voyage Reranker-2. The reranker will then re-evaluate and re-order these candidates based on its more sophisticated understanding of relevance, giving you a final, highly relevant list (e.g., the top N reranked documents).",

It handled inbound calls, answered property questions, and booked viewings live - with fallback to a human when needed. Another was for a senior care franchise: we processed 3,000+ calls per month, auto-transcribed them with Whisper, generated responses with GPT-4, and highlighted recurring issues. Both projects had structured fallback flows and CRM/logging integrations. Ready to build a tailored system for your customer service needs. Here are links to the two most relevant projects: Real Estate Voice Agent (Twilio + GPT-4.1): Senior Care Agent (Whisper + GPT-4):",

      "Tho Khuder: Hi Mykola Can I try the AI agent that you've done? May I get an estimation on what the cost would be?",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Can you explain a bit a little bit more on what you are looking to do? 1) What's your industry? What kind of requests are you looking to handle at this point? I saw that it is likely retail of electronics, is it so? it is really cool if so, have a lot of talks now with electronic retailers, both about voice assistants as well as shopping search assistants, since comparing products and choosing the right one is quite complex process 2) At this point we are not looking to integrate it into systems to perform actions right? What i mean is schedule bookings, change orders, etc. This functionality is inherently a lot more complex 3) Is it in Swedish language? I worked with Norwegian before, but essentially working with any language other than english drives complexity up as well Wednesday, May 21",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Hey Tho, Just checking in - let me know if you had a chance to go through the questions I sent. Ready to help once you’re ready."

      "Ackeem Marshall: Hi Mykola, Hope you're well, Your profile immediately stood out, and I believe you have precisely the skillset needed for my current project. I've created a mobile app in Replit and trying to enhance it with AI capabilities. I'm developing a system that uses a vector database to support a conversational LLM. What's crucial is evolving this into a reasoning engine that can effectively handle and interact with real-world data and user requests, like booking tables. Let me know if this sounds like something you'd be interested in exploring! Thanks Ackeem",
      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Hi Ackeem, Thanks for the invite – this sounds right up my alley. I’ve built several conversational LLM systems with vector search and RAG. Happy to dive into the details on a quick call this week - just let me know what time works for you! AM",

    "Project Description": " Automation & AI Workflow Consultant | Streamline LinkedIn–ChatGPT–CRM Recruitment Funnel Scripting & Automation Posted May 21, 2025 🔍 The Problem Right now, this is what the team is doing: - Manually searching for candidates and hiring managers on LinkedIn Recruiter. - Copying their LinkedIn profiles into ChatGPT to generate outreach messages. - Copy-pasting those messages into SourceWhale to launch campaigns. - For candidates, checking their location manually to calculate distance from client offices. - Repeating this process for every contact – it's time-consuming and inefficient. 🚀 What I Want I need someone to help me: - Automate profile capture from LinkedIn Recruiter (candidate and hiring manager). - Send profile data into ChatGPT automatically to generate tailored outreach messages. - Automatically push the output into SourceWhale campaigns without manual copying. - Automate location matching (e.g. check distance from candidate to client office). - Integrate our tools (ChatGPT, SourceWhale, RecruitCRM, AirCall, etc.) where possible to reduce double entry and speed things up. 🛠️ Tools We Use - LinkedIn Recruiter (for sourcing) - ChatGPT (for writing messages) - SourceWhale (for outreach campaigns) - RecruitCRM (for tracking candidates) - AirCall (for calls) - SourceWhale Notetaker (for meeting summaries) 🔧 What You Might Build/Use - API integrations (e.g. OpenAI API, Google Maps API) - Automation tools like Zapier, Make.com, or custom scripts - Chrome extensions or scraping tools (if ethical/compliant) - Database or dashboard for staging/editing before campaigns",

      "Mykola Kyrychenko: Hey Oliver, I am also based here in UK, specialize on AI, both complex and automations, have done something similar to what you are looking for, for Spanish consulting for lead qualification with Zapier. My focus though, is to help business solve the problem and for that we would use either custom AI or automation tool, depending on what needed. Will be happy to discuss:) ---"
